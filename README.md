# ISSA-KSU-Playbook
This is a repository that will be maintained by the ISSA of KSU club for use in CTFs, Hack-a-thons, and other cybersecurity adjacent activities. Created in the Summer of 2025, it seeks to help club member better learn the fundementals of red teaming, but also provide details and instructions on how to use the common tools for cybersecurity. 

There are three expressed goal for this repo to serve:
1) As a playbook for common tasks such as SQL injection or password cracking that no matter the problem the first few steps are almost always the same few, by checking easy to verify vulns to rule them out without wasting time.
2) Provide a all in one area to help newer member learn how to use common tools such as Wireshark, BurpSuite, and other free to use tools that are needed for competitions (red or blue teaming).
3) Create an area to store scripting of common competition tools (such as common passwork cracking commands, or custom python code for problems).

Hopefully this project will last beyond my time as club president, and help my fellow classmates learn new skills, while also leaving bits of their own skills for other to use and learn from.
